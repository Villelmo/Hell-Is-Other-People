<h2>The Concept</h2>

<p>This project is partially a satire, partially a commentary on my disdain for "social media", and partially an exploration of my own difficulties with severe social anxiety.</a>

<p>The title comes from an existentialist play by Jean-Paul Sartre entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit"><em>No Exit</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Backend</h2>

<p>This project was developed using the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> web application framework for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and is hosted on the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> cloud application platform. It is powered by the <a href="http://developer.foursquare.com">FourSquare API</a>.

<h2>The Map</h2>

<p>The map is generated using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a> with custom styling. Boundaries were chosen based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOEID">WOEID</a> of <a href="http://sigizmund.info/woeidinfo/?woeid=12589342">Manhattan</a> and centered on ITP.

<h2>The Math</h2>

<p>The locations given to avoid other users are calculated by generating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> with user check-ins as seeds. The diagram is generated using a <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi">javascript library</a> by <a href="http://www.raymondhill.net">Raymond Hill</a>.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>This project was concieved as a final for <a href="http://jamesgeorge.org/">James George</a>'s Emerging Processes in Video Art at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/">ITP</a>.
