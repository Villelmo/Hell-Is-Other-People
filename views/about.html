<h2>The Concept</h2>

<p>This project is partially a satire, partially a commentary on my disdain for "social media", and partially an exploration of my own difficulties with severe social anxiety.</a>

<p>The title comes from an existentialist play by Jean-Paul Sartre entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit"><em>No Exit</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Backend</h2>

<p>This project was developed using the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> web application framework for <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and is hosted on the <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> cloud application platform. It is powered by <a href="http://foursquare.com/">FourSquare</a>'s <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/realtime/">Real-Time API</a>.

<h2>The Map</h2>

<p>The map boundaries were chosen based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOEID">WOEID</a> of <a href="http://sigizmund.info/woeidinfo/?woeid=12589342">Manhattan</a>. The image was generated using <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill/">TileMill</a> and freely availble data. The vector overlay is generated in-browser using <a href="http://svgjs.com">svg.js</a>.

<h2>The Math</h2>

<p>The locations given to avoid other users are calculated by generating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> with user check-ins as seeds. Since Voronoi nodes are points equidistant to three or more sites, they work as a straightfoward way to find new points optimially distanced from the original set.</p>

<p>I'm certain that mathematicians out there are cringing at that description, but it works for my needs. The Voronoi diagram is generated using a <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi">javascript library</a> by <a href="http://www.raymondhill.net">Raymond Hill</a>.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>This project was concieved as a final for <a href="http://jamesgeorge.org/">James George</a>'s Emerging Processes in Video Art at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/">ITP</a>.
