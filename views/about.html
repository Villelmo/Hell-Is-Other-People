<h2>The Concept</h2>

<p>This project is partially a satire, partially a commentary on my disdain for "social media", and partially an exploration of my own difficulties with severe social anxiety.</a>

<p>The title comes from an existentialist play by Jean-Paul Sartre entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit"><em>No Exit</em></a>.</p>

<h2>The Math</h2>

<p>The locations given to avoid other users are calculated by generating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagram</a> with user check-ins as seeds. Since Voronoi nodes are points equidistant to three or more sites, they work as a straightfoward way to find new points optimially distanced from the original set.</p>

<p>I'm certain that mathematicians out there are cringing at that description, but it works for my needs. The Voronoi diagrame is generated using a <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi"javascript library</a> by <a href="http://www.raymondhill.net">Raymond Hill</a>.</p>
