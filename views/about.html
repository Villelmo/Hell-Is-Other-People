<p>This project is partially a satire, partially a commentary on my disdain for "social media", and partially an exploration of my own difficulties with severe social anxiety.</a>

<p>The name <em>Hell is Other People</em> comes from an existentialist play by Jean-Paul Sartre entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit"><em>No Exit</em></a>.</p>
